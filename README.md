## Folders

**root** - The two articles, `.bib` bibliography files, and `yml` files for markdown conversions, plus reproducible `docx`, `pdf`, `epub` versions. Work in the `qmd` markdown files. If you do not write R code, just ignore the R code chunks, and use it as a clean markdown text.

**bib** - please save here individual BibTex entries.  The consolidated entries will should be placed in one of the main `.bib` files in the root folder. The pandoc / knitr / RStudio workflow can have hickups with bib files, so try to save individual files first in `bib/xyz.bib`

**not_included** - user's scrap directory, excluded by `.gitignore`.  Please put your non-synchronized scrapbooks and code doodles here.
